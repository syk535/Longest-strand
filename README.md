# Longest-strand
We Assume that file names have the form "Sample.X".
Our samples have only one unique longest strand, and the sub-strand only shows up in two files. This is the simplest situation. The result is presented in "Output.txt".
I also used the sub-strands containing the first 1000 bytes of our files as new files. In this situation, we have more than one unique longest strand, and some strands show up in more than two files. The result is presented in "Output_for_Another_Sample.txt".
